Welcome to my homepage.

My full name is Doan Quang Tien (and Doãn Quang Tiến in Vietnamese).

I am a Pre-PhD student at [Institute of Mathematics, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology](http://math.ac.vn/en/trang-chu/gioi-thieu-vien-toan.html) (VAST), and under the supervision of Professor [Le Tuan Hoa](http://math.ac.vn/en/component/staff/?task=getProfile&staffID=25). Previously, he also advised my undergraduate thesis titled: "**Stability of the depth of the intersection of integral closures of powers of monomial ideals $$\bigcap_{n}\overline{I^n}$$.**"
