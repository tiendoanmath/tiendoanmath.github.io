Welcome to my homepage.

Here is my full name, written in my mother tongue: 

$$\text{Doãn Quang Tiến}$$

(in Vietnamese the family name comes first). I usually use the name **$$\text{Tien Doan}$$** for the research activity.

I am a Pre-PhD student at [Institute of Mathematics, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology](http://math.ac.vn/en/trang-chu/gioi-thieu-vien-toan.html) (VAST), under the supervision of Professor [Le Tuan Hoa](http://math.ac.vn/en/component/staff/?task=getProfile&staffID=25). Previously, he also advised my undergraduate thesis titled: "**Stability of the depth of the intersection of integral closures of powers of monomial ideals $$\bigcap_{n}\overline{I^n}$$.**"

## Research Interest

My research interests include algebraic geometry, number theory, commutative algebra, and their connections with other areas of mathematics.

For instance, in algebraic geometry, I am interested in $$\ell$$-adic (or $$p$$-adic) cohomology theories and their applications to problems in number theory, such as estimating exponential sums. In commutative algebra, I am often concerned with estimating an important invariant in algebraic geometry, namely, the Castelnuovo — Mumford regularity by using tools from combinatorics, linear programming, additive number theory, and so on.

## Research Projects

**1. Castelnuovo -- Mumford Regularity via Apéry sets**
- Mentor : Prof. Le Tuan Hoa -- Institute of Mathematics, VAST.
  - The goal of this project is to provide a relatively sharp new upper bound for the Castelnuovo -- Mumford regularity using Apéry sets. As an application, we identify a relatively general family of curves for which the regularity is determined by our upper bound, which significantly improves upon existing bounds such as the L'vovsky bound.

**2. Theory of Fourier -- Deligne Transform for $$\mathscr{D}$$-modules**
- Mentor : Prof. Jiangxue Fang -- Capital Normal University (CNU), China.
  - The goal of this project is to conduct a detailed and comprehensive study of the theory of Fourier -- Deligne transform for $$\mathscr{D}$$-modules, which was previously developed by Esnault and Bloch.

 **3. Exponential Sums and Rigid Cohomology**
- Mentor : Prof. Peigen Li -- Beijing Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Applications (BIMSA), China.
  - The goal of this project is to study the relationship between rigid cohomology and Dwork cohomology introduced by Adolphson and Sperber. As a corollary, we can calculate the rigid cohomology of Dwork isocrystal on torus.

 **4. Equidistributions of Generalized Jacobi Sums**
- In this paper, we extend results on classical Jacobi sums and employ a method similar to that of Ping Xi to obtain several results on their equidistributions.
