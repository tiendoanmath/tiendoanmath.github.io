title: "What is some general advice for a new PhD student?"

The following insights are quoted verbatim from Kevin H. Lin, a PhD student specializing in Algebraic Geometry, on Quora.

Some things I wish someone had told me before I started grad school:

1. Understand that, after the first year or so, the PhD is mainly about doing research. So make sure you are truly committed to research rather than, say, teaching.
2. Understand that research is very difficult — most of your ideas will not work, and you will often feel lost or uncertain. Expect to get stuck many many times. To succeed in grad school, you must embrace your stupidity and ignorance: "The importance of stupidity in scientific research".
3. When looking for an area of specialization, there are many things to consider. Your personal passion and interest level in the topic is of course important, but also consider how much other people care about the topic, the availability of strong and helpful advisors and colleagues, and the prevalence of open and doable problems in the area. You will get stuck, so it's important to have good colleagues around who can help you when that happens.
4. On that note: know that research often works best when it's collaborative; so don't isolate yourself — talk to other people and learn from them.
5. Be careful with areas that seem trendy or sexy — they may well become less trendy later on. Trendy topics also tend to attract a lot of attention and talent, making work in those areas very competitive.
6. When it comes to doing research, it is often tempting to try to read all of the background papers and material before trying to start working on something. The problem is that the academic literature is often very vast, and if you do this, you will never finish. In any case, it is usually better to start by working on small bite-sized problems that don't require a lot of background. In my experience, the best way to build background is by working on small problems, rather than reading extensively.
7. In most cases you are not going to find revolutionary new results — nor should you be expected to. It is far too easy to romanticize research and then get painfully disappointed when your results are modest. Of course you can aim to find big results and to solve the big problems but know that new knowledge progresses in baby steps and a PhD is just that: a baby step towards something hopefully greater. It doesn't need to be anything more and you should not pressure yourself to turn it into something more than that.

Good luck! A PhD is a challenging expedition to the frontiers of human knowledge. No matter the outcome, you will gain and learn a lot (about your field and also about yourself).

Here's a painting that I feel is appropriate:
